# - HTTPS (443) for package updates, Docker registry, software downloads
# - HTTP (80) for package repositories and legacy services
# - DNS (53) for name resolution

# Ignore specific egress rules for all security groups

# Public subnet auto-assignment - required for NAT and Docker host functionality
AVD-AWS-0164

# Ignore virtual environment files - these are dependencies, not our code
